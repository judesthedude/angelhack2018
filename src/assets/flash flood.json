        "mission": "The Rotary Foundation is a not-for-profit corporation funded solely by voluntary contributions from members and friends of Rotary who support its mission to advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace. \r\n\r\nUsing Rotary Foundation grants, Rotary's 34,000 clubs across the globe develop and carry out sustainable humanitarian projects and provide scholarships and professional training opportunities that promote peace, fight disease, provide clean water, sustain mothers and children, improve education, and strengthen local economies. \r\n\r\nThe Foundation is a worldwide leader in the efforts to eradicate polio through its partnership with the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. When Rotary launched its PolioPlus program in 1985, more than 350,000 people were afflicted with polio each year, and the disease was endemic in more than 125 countries. Since 1988, Rotary and its partners in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative have immunized over 2.5 billion children, reducing the incidence of polio by 99 percent and eradicating it from all but three countries. Rotary has contributed more than $1 billion and many thousands of hours to eradication effort. \r\n\r\nThe Foundation also funds the training of hundreds of peacemakers through the Rotary Peace Center program, which enables fellows to pursue a master's degree or professional certificate at one of Rotary's partner universities. Through academic training, study, and practice, the fellows become leaders who promote peace and aid conflict resolution in their communities and around the world.",

Since PAWS Chicago's founding in 1997, the number of homeless dogs and cats killed annually has dropped by nearly 80 percent: from more than 42,000 homeless pets killed in 1997 to under 10,000. PAWS Chicago is working to build a no kill Chicago - a city where pets are no longer destroyed just because they are homeless. PAWS Chicago will find new homes for nearly 6,000 homeless pets this year at the state-of-the-art Pippen Fasseas Lincoln Park Adoption, the satellite Glenn L. Felner North Shore Adoption Center and nearly weekly on- and off-site adoption events. The PAWS Chicago Lurie Spay/Neuter Clinic, the largest free spay/neuter clinic in Midwest, will sterilize more than 18,000 pets of low-income families this year.",
